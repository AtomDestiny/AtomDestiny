# Atom Destiny
Unreal Engine 5 Atom destiny game project

### Contribution

For editor and design we use [Unrealistic](https://unrealistic.dev/posts/unrealistic-style-guide) style guide. For C++ we use [Our](https://github.com/AtomDestiny/AtomDestiny/blob/main/CodingStyle.md) coding style guide.
So for contribution you should use them both.

### Third-party libraries

Project actively uses C++20 coroutines, so basic realization used from [UE5Coro](https://github.com/landelare/ue5coro). UE5Coro works only for Windows, so we made some source modification for macOS and clang.
