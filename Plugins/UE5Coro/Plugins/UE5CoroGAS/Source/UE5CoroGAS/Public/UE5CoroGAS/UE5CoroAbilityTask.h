/**
 * Usage summary:
 * - Add the necessary static UFUNCTION in your subclass
 * - Add your own delegates or use UUE5CoroSimpleAbilityTask
 * - Override Execute instead of Activate
 * - Run to completion to succeed, cancel to fail
 * - Invoke your delegates from Succeeded or Failed, not from Execute
