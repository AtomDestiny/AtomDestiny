# UE5Coro

These plugins implement C\+\+
[coroutines](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/coroutines) for
Unreal Engine 5 with a focus on gameplay logic and BP integration.

> [!NOTE]
> You're looking at the 1.x branch.<br>
> 2.0 is currently affected by multiple compiler bugs across MSVC and Clang.
> Previews will not be published until it's usable out of the box.<br>
> The changes required to update from 1.10 to 2.0 will be roughly as simple as
> updating Unreal Engine by one or two versions.

## Installation

Download the release that you wish to use from the
[Releases](https://github.com/landelare/ue5coro/releases) page, and copy the
contents of its Plugins folder into your project's Plugins folder.
Done correctly, you should end up with
`YourProject\Plugins\UE5Coro\UE5Coro.uplugin`.

_Note that 1.8 and earlier versions had a different folder structure._
_Refer to the README.md file from your chosen release for matching instructions._

## Project setup

Depending on your targeted language/engine version, you might need additional
setup to enable coroutines in your compiler:

### C++17

In your **Target.cs** files for projects where you wish to use coroutines,
add this line:
```c#
bEnableCppCoroutinesForEvaluation = true;
```

_Potential UE5.1 bug:_ if you're building the engine from source and it seems to
be rebuilding itself for no reason once you've done the Target.cs change above,
edit TargetRules.cs in the engine instead so that this flag is true by default.

### C++20, BuildSettingsVersion.V3 or older

In modules where you wish to use coroutines, add or change this line in the
corresponding **Build.cs** file:
```c#
CppStandard = CppStandardVersion.Cpp20;
```

### C++20, BuildSettingsVersion.V4

No additional setup is required.

## Usage

The UE5Coro plugin containing core functionality is enabled by default.
Reference the `"UE5Coro"` module from your Build.cs as you would any other
module and `#include "UE5Coro.h"`.

Other plugins, such as UE5CoroAI, UE5CoroGAS need to be manually enabled and
referenced normally: e.g., `"UE5CoroAI"` in Build.cs, `#include "UE5CoroAI.h"`
in your code.
All UE5Coro plugins follow this pattern of providing a single header.

Using these meta-headers is the recommended and supported approach.
You may opt to IWYU the various smaller headers, but no guidance is given as to
which feature requires which header.
IDEs most commonly used with Unreal Engine are known to fail to suggest the
correct header for some features.

## Feature overview

Click these links for the detailed description of the main features provided
by these plugins, or keep reading for a few highlights.

### UE5Coro

* [Async coroutines](Docs/Async.md) control their own resumption by awaiting
various awaiter objects. They can be used to implement BP latent actions such as
Delay, or as a generic fork in code execution like AsyncTask, but not
necessarily involving multithreading.
  * [Cancellation](Docs/Cancellation.md) support has its own page.
* [Generators](Docs/Generator.md) are caller-controlled and return a variable
number of results without having to allocate and go through a temporary TArray.
* [Overview of built-in awaiters](Docs/Awaiters.md) that you can use with async
coroutines.

### UE5CoroAI

* [AI module and navigation system](Docs/AI.md) integration.

### UE5CoroGAS

* [Gameplay Ability System](Docs/GAS.md) integration.

## Async coroutine examples

Return `UE5Coro::TCoroutine<>` from a function to make it coroutine enabled and
support co_await inside.
UFUNCTIONs need to use the `FAsyncCoroutine` wrapper.

Having a `FLatentActionInfo` parameter makes the coroutine implement a BP latent
action.
You do not need to do anything with this parameter, just have it and UE5Coro
will register it with the latent action manager.
World context objects are also supported and automatically processed.
It's recommended to have them as the first parameter.
Don't forget the necessary UFUNCTION metadata to make this a latent node in BP!

```cpp
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Meta = (Latent, LatentInfo = "LatentInfo"))
FAsyncCoroutine AExampleActor::Latent(FLatentActionInfo LatentInfo)
{
    // This will *not* block the game thread for a second!
    co_await UE5Coro::Latent::Seconds(1.0);
    OneSecondLater();
}
```

The returned struct has no use in BP and is automatically hidden:
![AExampleActor::Latent as a BP node](Docs/latent_node.png)

You're not limited to BP latent actions, or UCLASS members:

```cpp
UE5Coro::TCoroutine<> MyGlobalHelperFunction()
{
    co_await UE5Coro::Latent::Seconds(1.0);
    OneSecondLater();
}
```

Or even regular functions:

```cpp
void Example(int Value)
{
    auto Lambda = [Value]() -> UE5Coro::TCoroutine<int>
    {
        co_await UE5Coro::Tasks::MoveToTask();
        co_return PerformExpensiveTask(Value);
    };
    int ExpensiveResult = Lambda().GetResult();
}
```

Both BP latent actions and free-running asynchronous coroutines have a unified
feature set: you can seamlessly co_await the same things from both and if
needed, your BP latent action becomes a threading placeholder or additional
behind-the-scenes latent actions are started as needed.

BP Latent actions are considered complete for BP when control leaves the scope
of the coroutine body completely, either implicitly (running to the final `}`)
or explicitly via `co_return;`.

Asynchronous coroutines (in both modes) synchronously return to their callers at
the first co_await or co_return that they encounter and the rest of the function
body runs either independently (in async mode) or through the latent action
manager (in latent mode).

Everything co_awaitable works in every asynchronous coroutine, regardless of its
BP integration:

```cpp
using namespace UE5Coro;

UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Meta = (Latent, LatentInfo = "LatentInfo"))
FAsyncCoroutine UExampleFunctionLibrary::K2_Foo(FLatentActionInfo LatentInfo)
{
    // You can freely hop between threads even though this is BP:
    co_await Async::MoveToThread(ENamedThreads::AnyBackgroundThreadNormalTask);
    DoExpensiveThingOnBackgroundThread();

    // However, awaiting latent actions has to be started from the game thread:
    co_await Async::MoveToGameThread();
    co_await Latent::Seconds(1.0f);
}
```

There are various other engine features with coroutine support including some
engine types that are made directly co_awaitable in `TCoroutine`s.
Check out the [Awaiters](Docs/Awaiters.md) page for an overview.

## Generator examples

Generators can be used to return an arbitrary number of items from a function
without having to pass them through temp arrays, etc.
In C# they're known as iterators.

Returning `UE5Coro::TGenerator<T>` makes a function coroutine enabled,
supporting `co_yield`:

```cpp
using namespace UE5Coro;

TGenerator<FString> MakeParkingSpaces(int Num)
{
    for (int i = 1; i <= Num; ++i)
        co_yield FString::Printf(TEXT("🅿️ %d"), i);
}

// Elsewhere
for (const FString& Str : MakeParkingSpaces(123))
    Process(Str);
```

co_yield and co_await cannot be mixed.
Asynchronous coroutines control their own execution and wait for certain events,
while generators are caller-controlled and yield values on demand.

In particular, it's not guaranteed that your generator function body will even
run to completion if your caller decides to stop early.
This enables scenarios where generators may co_yield an infinite number of
elements and callers only taking a finite few:

```cpp
using namespace UE5Coro;

TGenerator<int> NotTrulyInfinite()
{
    FString WillBeDestroyed = TEXT("Read on");
    int* Dangerous = new int;
    for (;;)
        co_yield 1;
    delete Dangerous;
}

// Elsewhere:
TGenerator<int> Generator = NotTrulyInfinite();
for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
    Generator.Resume();
```

In this case, your coroutine stack will be unwound when the TGenerator object
is destroyed, and the destructors of locals within the coroutine run like usual,
as if the last `co_yield` was a `throw` (but no exceptions are involved).

In the example above, the FString will be freed but the `delete` line will never
run.
Use RAII or helpers such as `ON_SCOPE_EXIT` if you expect to not run to
completion.
